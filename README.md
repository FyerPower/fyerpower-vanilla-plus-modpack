# FyerPower Vanilla+ — Community Modpack

A light, polished Vanilla+ modpack built exclusively for FyerPower’s Community Server.
This pack focuses on keeping Minecraft’s classic feel while adding small, high-quality enhancements that improve gameplay without changing the core experience.

Uploaded to CurseForge for easy installation and updates for all community members.

## Version & Update Plan

Currently built for Minecraft 1.21.1, with long-term plans to keep the pack updated across future Minecraft releases. All included mods are chosen carefully to avoid major world-breaking changes and to remain compatible as updates roll out.

## Mod Philosophy

The goal of this pack is to remain as close to vanilla as possible while adding:

- Quality-of-life features
- Lightweight performance improvements
- Enhancements that feel like they could belong in the base game
- Mods that are safe to remove or replace in future versions without breaking worlds

- **Traveler’s Backpacks** — Portable storage with functionality
- **Tom’s Simple Storage** — A simple, scalable storage network system

### Travel & Convenience

### Plus many more!

Performance optimizers, visual enhancements, shader support, and subtle quality-of-life mods all designed to keep the experience smooth and familiar.
